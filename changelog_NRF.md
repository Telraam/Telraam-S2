# Changelog for the NRF firmware of the Telraam S2 devices

## 1.10 (31/01/2023)
- fixed bug in time handling where the time skipped from 28/01/2023 to 01/03/2023
- added sim-iccid in the hello message

## 1.9 (26/01/2023)
- changed time state (modem or config) behaviour to not be persistent and reset with power cycle

## 1.8 (4/01/2023)
- fixed issue with network operator not providing the time

## 1.7.1 (12/12/2022)
- print network time -> check issue with network operator not providing the time

## 1.7 (no date, internal bagaar fw)
- changes for production testing

## 1.6 (21/10/2022)
- modify the QR code that it also contains the 2 letter characters, not only the numeric part?

## 1.5 (21/10/2022)
- memory optimization of 38KB RAM in the image array
- fixing the issue that a picture request did not always complete.
As Peter mentioned, this is getting more or less to the final firmware üòä. The main thing that we still need to verify and finetune is the test setup for production (which Alexander is preparing).
- Messages preferably appear vertically centred on the screen and not on top as they appear now.
- Put the serial number under the QR code in one line (slightly smaller font, but should not be an issue)

## 1.4 (12/10/2022)
- Finalized screen anti-aliasing (have not had an update on that since the last mails a month ago, but it was almost done)
- manually set ROI sent to K210 chip (this is currently not being transferred by the NRF to the K210)
- QoS to 0 -> no more puback messages so #messages / 2 [Ack is taken care of by the SDK: ‚Äúhowever since you are using the Thingstream SDK, there is a low level protocol ack back following a publish, so the client application can still be confident that the message was delivered to the broker‚Äù]
- Spread out the data transmission a bit from 0 to a max where max is a duration in seconds that is customisable via a config update message (for load balancing in the future) - so transfer would happen at a random moment between 0 and max.
